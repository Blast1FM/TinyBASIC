Tiny BASIC

NAME
tb - Tiny BASIC interpreter and compiler

SYNOPSIS
tb [ options ] program-file
tbc [ options ] program-file

DESCRIPTION
Tb is an implementation of the Tiny BASIC language. It conforms to the specification by Dennis Allison, published in People's Computer Company Vol.4 No.2 and reprinted in Dr. Dobb's Journal, January 1976.

The package provides both an interpreter, tb, and a compiler, tbc. Both of these tools are non-interactive, and load their input from a source file written in a text editor. No interactive interpreter is provided.

Tb provides additional features in the form of optional line numbers (also known as numeric line labels), and a configurable upper limit to the line labels in place of the 255 of Allison's specification. 

OPTION FORMAT
Tb options may either be traditional POSIX-style one letter options, or GNU-style long options. POSIX options start with a single "-", while long options start with a "--".

OPTIONS
Tb accepts the following options.

-n value
--line-numbers=value
Determines the handling of numeric line labels (known as line numbers in BASIC). An argument of m or mandatory causes tb to require a numeric label for every program line, in ascending order. An argument of i or implied causes tb to supply numeric labels internally for each line that lacks them; care must be taken when labelling lines so that there is room for a sequence of numbers between one label and the next. An argument of o or optional makes numeric labels completely optional; they need not be in sequence.

-N limit
--line-number-limit limit
Specifies the largest numeric line label allowed in the BASIC program. The default is 255. The new limit may be up to 32767.
